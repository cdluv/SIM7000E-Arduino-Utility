Some operators need to set APN first when registering the network. 
```
AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","globaldata.iot"
OK
```

Enable RF
```
AT+CFUN=1
OK
+CPIN: READY
```

Check PS service.
```
AT+CGATT?

OK
```

Activate network, Activate 0th PDP. 
```
AT+CNACT=0,1 
OK
+APP PDP: 0,ACTIVE

```

Get local IP
```
AT+CNACT?
+CNACT: 0,1,"10.185.48.73" 
+CNACT: 1,0,"0.0.0.0" 
+CNACT: 2,0,"0.0.0.0"

```

Build a TCP/UDP connection without SSL 

5.1.1 Build an ordinary TCP/UDP connection 

Example of Build an ordinary TCP/UDP connection. 

Check the 0th PDN/PDP local IP. 
```
AT+CNACT? 
+CNACT: 0,1,"10.185.48.73"" 
+CNACT: 1,0,"0.0.0.0" 
+CNACT: 2,0,"0.0.0.0"
